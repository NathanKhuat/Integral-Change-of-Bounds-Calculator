# Integral Change Of Bounds Calculator

The inspiration for this project originiated from my freshman Multi-Variable Calculus course. I particularly struggled with changing the bounds of integration in triple integrals and recall being stuck on numerous homework problems. I decided to pursue this project to not only better understand the mechanics of integration, but to also provide a tool future Calculus students.

## **Problem:** <br />
There does not exist an online tool/Calculator to swap the bounds for integration in definite **double and triple integrals** 

## **Solution:** <br />
Create an interactive tool to enable students to change the bounds of integration.

Additionally, the beta is deployed on AWS which can be found [here](https://flask-service.dk0mtqb43o4ic.us-east-1.cs.amazonlightsail.com/).
