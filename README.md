# Integral Change Of Bounds Calculator

Inspiration: The idea for this project originiated from my freshman Multi-Variable Calculus course, where we were working with double in triple integrals. I particularly struggled with changing the bounds of integration in triple integrals and recall being stuck on numerous homework problems. I decided to pursue this project to not only better understand the mechanics of integration, but to also provide a tool future Calculus students.

Function: This calculator take integrals of the form dydx and turn them into dxdy and visa versa. <br />
It uses Sympy for all operations. It runs on a flask server hosted over AWS.

THe beta is deployed on AWS which can be found [here](https://flask-service.dk0mtqb43o4ic.us-east-1.cs.amazonlightsail.com/).
