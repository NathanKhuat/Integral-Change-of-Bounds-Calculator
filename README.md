# Integral Change Of Bounds Calculator

The inspiration for this project originiated from my freshman Multi-Variable Calculus course. I particularly struggled with changing the bounds of integration in triple integrals and recall being stuck on numerous homework problems. I decided to pursue this project to not only better understand the mechanics of integration, but to also provide a tool future Calculus students.

## **Problem:** <br />
There does not exist an online tool/Calculator to swap the bounds for integration in definite **double and triple integrals**
